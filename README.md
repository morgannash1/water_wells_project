# Tanzania Water Wells Project
**Author**: [Morgan Nash](mailto:morganmichellenash@gmail.com)

# Overview
This project aims to build classification models to predict the functionality of water wells in Tanzania to help Non-Government Organizations determine which wells they need to repair as well as give insite to factors that most strongly affect water pump functionality.

# Business Understanding 
Tanzania is facing a water crisis due to many factors, some of them include climate change (droughts), higher demand for water due to increased population, and infrastructure and management issues (lack of funding for investment in proper infrastructure). Tanzania's water supply sytem has frequent water pump breakdowns which lead to frequent disruptions in water supply. Not having access to clean water means significant time and energy is spent on travelling to collect water, taking people away from work leading to subsequent socio-economic losses. Access to safe water and sanitation improves health and helps families protect themselves from illness and disease. The Government of Tanzania as well as certain Non-Government Organizations aim to mitigate the water crisis by strategically increasing investment in the maintenance and functionality of water wells across the country.
## Stakeholders:
* Non Government Organizations (NGOs) focused on helping Tanzania gain clean water access
* Government of Tanzania
# Objective 
This project aims to:
* Gain deeper understanding of the factors that affect the functionality of a pump
* Build classification models using the features of the dataset
* Test and evaluate the models
* Address conclusions, recommendations, and limitations that the stakeholders can use
# Data Understanding 
The data for this project comes from Taarifa, who compiled data from the Tanzania Ministry of Water, and was accessed through DrivenData.org. The data contains 59,400 records of water wells, each with 41 features. Our target is status_group which contains labeling of whether a pump is functional, functional needs repair, or non functional. After cleaning the data, we'll be using the features to build a classification model to predict the status of water wells.
